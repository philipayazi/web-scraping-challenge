# web-scraping-challenge

Web scraping is a process of automating the extraction of data in an efficient and fast way. With the help of web scraping, you can extract data from any website, no matter how large is the data, on your computer. Moreover, websites may have data that you cannot copy and paste. Web scraping can help you extract any kind of data that you want.

In this project, various NASA media have been web scrapped. Specifically, NASA Mars news site, JPL Mars space images, NASA twitter account for weather updates, and Mars facts web page. All of this has been stored into MongoDB and presented into a web page using a flask app.
